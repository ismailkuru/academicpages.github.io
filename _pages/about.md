I am Ismail Kuru, a PhD student at [Drexel University School of Computer Science](https://drexel.edu/cci/academics/computer-science-department). I am advised by [Dr. Colin S. Gordon](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~csgordon/). Before, I finished my M.S courses [TU Munich](http://www.in.tum.de/en/for-prospective-students/masters-programs/computational-science-and-engineering/) and graduated with M.S. degree from [Koc University](https://eng.ku.edu.tr/en/academics/computer-engineering/) in 2015. Thanks [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-scholarship-europe-middle-east-africa/) for supporting me through a Microsoft Research scholarship during my study for the M.S degree.

My research interests lie in,
======

* Programming Languages (Type Systems for Safe Concurrent Heap Manipulation), 
* Program Logics (Separation Logic, Refinement and Modalities),
* Systems (Memory Models, Hypervisor, Filesystems), and
* Concurrency (Transactions, Read-Copy-Update & Other Highly Concurrent Sharing Techniques).
